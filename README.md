In order to do USER auth I would implement it with the Devise Gem. I would follow this tutorial https://medium.com/@greenboyroshan/creating-user-signin-and-signup-in-rails-6-using-gem-devise-part-i-334745e4cd9b

For API auth I would follow this tutorial using JWT Tokens - https://medium.com/@billy.sf.cheng/a-rails-6-application-part-1-api-1ee5ccf7ed01
